# KCTalkingCards

An Inscryption mod that adds the talking cards from Part 1 into Kaycee's Mod. The Stoat, Stinkbug, and Stunted Wolf will show up in card choices and the mod also adds a starter deck containing the three talking cards.

![Talking Cards Introduction](.github/talking-cards-introduction.png)

The talking cards use their base animated portrait. Any dialogue when you draw them to your hand from your deck has been skipped to speed up play. Talking cards are unique and once you have a talking card in your deck, no other copy of that talking card will show up in card choices.

You can fine-tune how you want the talking cards to work in your configuration. Please check the settings out!

## Balancing

The talking cards use their original Part 1 stats by default but you can apply some balancing by setting `TalkingCardsBalance` to `true` in the configuration. You can see the exact changes for the balancing below but the Stoat and Stunted Wolf would be functionally identical to the Stoat and Wolf cards in Kaycee's Mod. As the Stinkbug has no direct counterpart it has been manually balanced to account for its cheap cost and sigil.

If you have the [MycoMerger](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/RykeDaxter/MycoMerger/) mod installed, you can also set `TalkingCardsNontalkingMerge` to `true` to allow the talking cards to be merged with their non-talking counterpart at the Mycologists event. You can change what that counterpart is in the configuration but the recommended default is Talking Stoat with Stoat, Stinkbug with RingWorm, and Stunted Wolf with Wolf. When setting the card name in the configuration, it must be the [internal card name](https://github.com/MADH95/JSONLoader/blob/master/Card%20Names.txt) and not the displayed card name.

The Talking Cards starter deck when balanced is roughly equivalent to the Vanilla starter deck, swapping out the Bullfrog for the Stinkbug. The balancing attempts to bring the cards closer to the base game, giving no advantage for having them other than the cards talking and being animated. Also note that if you are given a Ring Worm instead of pelts, it will not be replaced with Stinkbug like any other bonuses at beginning of game.

## Issues and Future Updates

### Issues

* No known issues but let me know if you find any!

### Future Updates

I've added everything I could think of so no further updates are planned. The mod only focuses on including the talking cards from Part 1 into Kaycee's Mod so there's not much more to add.

If you find an issue or have suggestions, please feel free to contact me on the [Inscryption Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/ZQPvfKEpwM) or create an Issue on the [Github repository](https://github.com/RykeDaxter/KCTalkingCards).
